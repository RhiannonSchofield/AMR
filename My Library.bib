With an electrically opaque cobalt/overlayer interface, the AMR ratio is shown to vary in inverse proportion to the cobalt film thickness; an indication that in-plane AMR is a consequence of anisotropic scattering with both volume and interfacial contributions. The interface scattering anisotropy opposes the volume scattering contribution, causing the AMR ratio to diminish as the cobalt film thickness is reduced. An intrinsic interface effect explains the significantly reduced AMR ratio in ultra-thin films.},

  abstract = {The multilayer modulation of Ni with Pd gives rise to interesting features such as inverted hysteresis, enhanced magnetization and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy development, all strongly influenced by the modulation parameters m, n. In an effort to study the corresponding electrical behavior and its correlation to magnetic features, Pd\textemdash{}Ni multilayers with various m, n, were developed. Since the system does not exhibit the giant magnetoresistance effect, it becomes appropriate for the study of anisotropic magnetoresistance. A series of measurements of electrical resistance and magnetoresistance (MR) at temperatures 10\textendash{}350 K, in samples with 1 {$<$} m, n {$<$} 20 were performed. Four electrical contacts were made on the surface of the samples while the direction of the electric current is parallel to the sample surface (CIP geometry). The dependence of the magnetoresistance on the magnetic field orientation is studied via various experimental set-ups. A simple model to isolate the magnetic term from the over-all electrical resistance is proposed in order to comprehend the magnetic origin of the anisotropic magnetoresistance. Consequently, the temperature dependence and the parametrisation of anisotropic magnetoresistance is examined in Pd\textemdash{}Ni system while the various magnetoresistance contributions arising from different scattering mechanisms may be separated.},

  abstract = {We have fabricated Co/Ni multilayer thin films with a constant Co thickness of 2.2 nm, Ni thickness changing from 0.5 to 5.0 nm, and a total of 20 bilayers using dc magnetron sputtering. The magnetic measurements show that these multilayers have an in-plane uniaxial anisotropic properties. These multilayers show a steep magnetoresistance change with low saturation magnetic field, an especially large magnetoresistance change between magnetic field H applied parallel and perpendicular to the in-plane easy axis. For H parallel to the multilayer easy axis and H at 45/spl deg/ to the current I, a magnetoresistance ratio of 15.0\% with a FWHM of 13 Oe was obtained. While for H perpendicular to the multilayer easy axis and H at 45/spl deg/ to the current I, a magnetoresistance ratio of 19.1\% with a FWHM of 34 Oe was obtained. The former implies a magnetoresistance sensitivity of 1.15\%/Oe, while the sensitivity of the latter is just 0.56 \%/Oe. All the peaks of the magnetoresistance curve appeared at the coercive field H/sub c/ of the multilayers. The most important characteristic of the magnetoresistance change were a sharp increase in resistance followed by a very steep decrease with increasing H.},

The relationship between the magnetoresistance and the magnetic anisotropy field is demonstrated for films exhibiting either anisotropic magnetoresistance or giant magnetoresistance. The magnetoresistances of multilayer films both with and without magnetic interaction between adjacent layers are compared.

  title = {Spin-Orbit Phenomena and Interfacial Proximity Effects in Magnetic Multilayers},
  abstract = {This thesis examines phenomena originating from the spin-orbit interaction in the context of interfacial effects. Four effects were studied, the anisotropic magnetoresistance, spin-orbit torques, magnetic damping and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

The anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) was studied in Ni, Ni95V5 and Ni95Cr5 thin films. The absolute resistivity change due to AMR reduced with decreasing film thickness. This was explained in terms of enhanced electron-magnon spin-flip scattering in the presence of reduced dimensionality. It was shown that the Campbell, Fert and Jaoul model could be extended to include this generalised thickness dependence.

Spin-orbit torques were investigated in multilayer structures with different magnetic anisotropies. Current-induced magnetisation reversal, due to the spin-Hall efect of Pt, was observed in a symmetric Pt/Co/Pt sample with weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. No evidence for the Rashba effect was found in this symmetric structure. A spin Hall angle of (0.13 +- 0:06) was extracted for Pt.

Using x-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity, the interfacial proximity induced magnetism (PIM) in Pt was investigated in Pt/Co/Pt multilayer structures with in-plane magnetic anisotropy and characterised as a function of Au and Ir spacer layers at the Co/Pt interface. The PIM was shown to depend strongly on interface morphology and decayed rapidly with increasing spacer layer thickness.

The magnetic damping and Dzyaloshinkskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) were measured in the same samples to investigate the contribution of the PIM to these effects. It was shown that the magnetic damping was dominated by the d-d hybridisation at the Co/Pt interface which reduced as spacer layers of increasing thickness were inserted. It was not clear whether the loss of PIM plays a substantial role in this. The DMI was shown to increase as Au and Ir spacer layers were added, due to the prevention of cancellation of opposite DMI  contributions from the Pt interfaces. This rise in DMI was on a different lengthscale than was found for the loss of PIM. The results suggested no correlation between the PIM and DMI.},

  title = {Formation of Bright Solitary Matter-Waves},
  abstract = {This thesis presents the development of an experimental apparatus to produce Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with tunable interparticle interactions. The ability to precisely control the strength of these interactions, and even to switch them from repulsive to attractive, allows one to probe novel regimes of condensate physics, from the collapse of attractively interacting BECs and the formation of solitary matter-waves to the observation of beyond mean-field effects in strongly repulsive condensates.    

The construction and characterisation of both a single and crossed beam optical dipole trap is presented. In the single beam case we develop a technique allowing the guided transport of atoms along the beam and up to a room-temperature surface; a technique which can be used to evaporatively cool the trapped atomic cloud. We produce Bose-Einstein condensates of 87Rb in the F=1, mF=-1 state in this trap, comparing the effect of beam waist on the evaporation trajectory. In the crossed beam trap Bose-Einstein condensation of 87Rb is realised in three distinct trapping configurations, along with a 1D optical lattice formed by changing the polarisation of the beams. 

A method of direct cooling of 85Rb atoms in the crossed trap is developed using a magnetic Feshbach resonance to precisely tune both the elastic and inelastic scattering properties of the atoms. The resonance used for this work occurs at 155G in collisions between atoms in the F=2, mF=-2 state of 85Rb. Bose-Einstein condensates of up to 40,000 85Rb atoms are formed in this trap and we demonstrate the presence of tunable interatomic interactions, exploring the collapse phenomenon associated with attractive condensates. 

By loading the 85Rb condensate into a quasi-1D waveguide we show that stable attractive condensates can be created, taking the form of bright solitary matter-waves. We observe a solitary wave of \textasciitilde{}2,000 atoms which propagates, without dispersion, along the waveguide over a distance of \textasciitilde{}1.1mm. The particle-like nature of the solitary wave is demonstrated by classical reflection of the wavepacket from a repulsive Gaussian barrier.},

The solitons are set in motion by offsetting the optical potential, and are observed to propagate in the potential for many oscillatory cycles without spreading. We observe a soliton train, containing many solitons; repulsive interactions between neighbouring solitons are inferred from their motion.},

In particular, we present a general and comprehensive analysis of the case where two fast-moving bright solitons collide at the location of the barrier. In the limiting case of a delta-function barrier, we use a quasi-analytic method to show that the relative norms of the outgoing waves depends sinusoidally on the relative phase of the incoming waves, and to determine whether one, or both, of the outgoing waves are bright solitons. We show using numerical simulations that this quasi-analytic result is valid in the high velocity limit: outside this limit nonlinear effects introduce a skew to the phase-dependence, which we quantify. Finally, we numerically explore the effects of introducing a finite-width Gaussian barrier. Our results are particularly relevant, as they can be used to describe a range of interferometry experiments using bright solitary matter-waves.},

The potential of interaction between solitons derived from VA is shown to be of molecular type, i.e. attractive at long distances and repulsive at short distances. Normal modes of a three-soliton molecule are investigated by computing small amplitude oscillations of individual solitons near their equilibrium positions. Symmetric and asymmetric stretched states of the molecule are prepared and used as initial conditions in numerical simulations of the nonlocal Gross-Pitaevskii equation. As opposed to usual triatomic molecules, we find that the frequency of the asymmetric mode of a three-soliton molecule is smaller than the one of the symmetric mode.

As other ideas prevailed at the time, he abandoned the development of his conception. But for the past twenty years, once again convinced, like Einstein, that present-day quantum mechanics is only a statistical theory and does not give a true picture of physical reality, he has again taken up his old ideas and developed them considerably. He has in particular introduced an element of randomness into the theory and has thus attained to a ``hidden thermodynamics of particles,'' the results of which appear to be very interesting.},
